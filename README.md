# VALL'E

An unofficial PyTorch implementation of [VALL-E](https://valle-demo.github.io/), based on the [EnCodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec) tokenizer.

## Requirements

* [`DeepSpeed`](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed#requirements):
  - DeepSpeed training is Linux only. Installation under Windows should ignore trying to install DeepSpeed.
  - If your config YAML has the training backend set to [`deepspeed`], you will need to have a GPU that DeepSpeed has developed and tested against, as well as a CUDA or ROCm compiler pre-installed to install this package.

* [`espeak-ng`](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/):
  - For phonemizing text, this repo requires `espeak`/`espeak-ng` installed.
  - Linux users can consult their package managers on installing `espeak`/`espeak-ng`.
  - Windows users are required to install [`espeak-ng`](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases/tag/1.51#Assets).
    + additionally, you may be require dto set the `PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_LIBRARY` environment variable to specify the path to `libespeak-ng.dll`.

## Install

Simply run `pip install git+https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/vall-e`.

I've tested this repo under Python versions `3.10.9` and `3.11.3`.

## Try Me

To quickly try it out, you can choose between the following modes:

* AR only: `python -m vall_e.models.ar yaml="./data/config.yaml"`
* NAR only: `python -m vall_e.models.nar yaml="./data/config.yaml"`
* AR+NAR: `python -m vall_e.models.base yaml="./data/config.yaml"`

Each model file has a barebones trainer and inference routine.

## Pre-Trained Model

My pre-trained weights can be acquired from [here](https://huggingface.co/ecker/vall-e).

For example:

```
git lfs clone --exclude "*.h5" https://huggingface.co/ecker/vall-e ./data/
python -m vall_e "The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks." "./path/to/an/utterance.wav" --out-path="./output.wav" yaml="./data/config.yaml"
```

## Train

Training is very dependent on:
* the quality of your dataset.
* how much data you have.
* the bandwidth you quantized your audio to.

### Notices

#### Modifying `prom_levels`, `resp_levels`, Or `tasks` For A Model

If you're wanting to increase the `prom_levels` for a given model, or increase the `tasks` levels a model accepts, you will need to export your weights and set `train.load_state_dict` to `True` in your configuration YAML.

### Pre-Processed Dataset

> **Note** A pre-processed "libre" is being prepared. This contains only data from the LibriTTS and LibriLight datasets (and MUSAN for noise), and culled out any non-libre datasets.



### Leverage Your Own Dataset

> **Note** It is highly recommended to utilize [mrq/ai-voice-cloning](https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/ai-voice-cloning) with `--tts-backend="vall-e"` to handle transcription and dataset preparations.

1. Put your data into a folder, e.g. `./data/custom`. Audio files should be named with the suffix `.wav` and text files with `.txt`.

2. Quantize the data: `python -m vall_e.emb.qnt ./data/custom`

3. Generate phonemes based on the text: `python -m vall_e.emb.g2p ./data/custom`

4. Customize your configuration and define the dataset by modifying `./data/config.yaml`. Refer to `./vall_e/config.py` for details. If you want to choose between different model presets, check `./vall_e/models/__init__.py`.

If you're interested in creating an HDF5 copy of your dataset, simply invoke: `python -m vall_e.data --action='hdf5' yaml='./data/config.yaml'`

5. Train the AR and NAR models using the following scripts: `python -m vall_e.train yaml=./data/config.yaml`

You may quit your training any time by just typing `quit` in your CLI. The latest checkpoint will be automatically saved.

### Dataset Formats

Two dataset formats are supported:
* the standard way:
  - data is stored under `${speaker}/${id}.phn.txt` and `${speaker}/${id}.qnt.pt`
* using an HDF5 dataset:
  - you can convert from the standard way with the following command: `python3 -m vall_e.data yaml="./path/to/your/config.yaml"`
  - this will shove everything into a single HDF5 file and store some metadata alongside (for now, the symbol map generated, and text/audio lengths)
  - be sure to also define `use_hdf5` in your config YAML.

## Export

Both trained models *can* be exported, but is only required if loading them on systems without DeepSpeed for inferencing (Windows systems). To export the models, run: `python -m vall_e.export yaml=./data/config.yaml`.

This will export the latest checkpoints under `./data/ckpt/ar-retnet-2/fp32.pth` and `./data/ckpt/nar-retnet-2/fp32.pth` to be loaded on any system with PyTorch.

## Synthesis

To synthesize speech, invoke either (if exported the models): `python -m vall_e <text> <ref_path> <out_path> --ar-ckpt ./models/ar.pt --nar-ckpt ./models/nar.pt` or `python -m vall_e <text> <ref_path> <out_path> yaml=<yaml_path>`

Some additional flags you can pass are:
* `--max-ar-steps`: maximum steps for inferencing through the AR model. Each second is 75 steps.
* `--ar-temp`: sampling temperature to use for the AR pass. During experimentation, `0.95` provides the most consistent output.
* `--nar-temp`: sampling temperature to use for the NAR pass. During experimentation, `0.2` provides the most clean output.
* `--device`: device to use (default: `cuda`, examples: `cuda:0`, `cuda:1`, `cpu`)

## To-Do

* reduce load time for creating / preparing dataloaders.
* train and release a model.
* extend to multiple languages (VALL-E X) and ~~extend to~~ train SpeechX features.
