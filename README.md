# VALL'E

An unofficial PyTorch implementation of [VALL-E](https://valle-demo.github.io/), based on the [EnCodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec) tokenizer.

> **Note** this is highly experimental. While I've seem to have audited and tighened down as much as I can, I'm still trying to produce a decent model out of it. You're free to train your own model if you happen to have the massive compute for it, but it's quite the beast to properly feed. This README won't get much love until I truly nail out a quasi-decent model.

> **Note** You can follow along with my pseudo-blog in an issue [here](https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/ai-voice-cloning/issues/152). I currently have a dataset clocking in at 3400+ trimmed hours.

## Requirements

If your config YAML has the training backend set to [`deepspeed`](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed#requirements), you will need to have a GPU that DeepSpeed has developed and tested against, as well as a CUDA or ROCm compiler pre-installed to install this package.

## Install

```
pip install git+https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/vall-e
```

Or you may clone by:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/vall-e.git
```

I've tested this repo under Python versions `3.10.9` and `3.11.3`.

## Try Me

To quickly try it out, you can choose between the following modes:

* AR only: `python -m vall_e.models.ar yaml="./data/config.yaml"`
* NAR only: `python -m vall_e.models.nar yaml="./data/config.yaml"`
* AR+NAR: `python -m vall_e.models.base yaml="./data/config.yaml"`

Each model file has a barebones trainer and inference routine.

## Train

Training is very dependent on:
* the quality of your dataset.
* how much data you have.
* the bandwidth you quantized your audio to.

### Notices

#### Modifying `prom_levels` or `tasks` For a Model

If you're wanting to increase the `prom_levels` for a given model, or increase the `tasks` levels a model accepts, you will need to export your weights and set `train.load_state_dict` to `True` in your configuration YAML.

### Leverage Your Own Dataset

> **Note** It is highly recommended to utilize [mrq/ai-voice-cloning](https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/ai-voice-cloning) with `--tts-backend="vall-e"` to handle transcription and dataset preparations.

1. Put your data into a folder, e.g. `./data/custom`. Audio files should be named with the suffix `.wav` and text files with `.txt`.

2. Quantize the data: `python -m vall_e.emb.qnt ./data/custom`

3. Generate phonemes based on the text: `python -m vall_e.emb.g2p ./data/custom`

4. Customize your configuration and define the dataset by modifying `./data/config.yaml`. Refer to `./vall_e/config.py` for details. If you want to choose between different model presets, check `./vall_e/models/__init__.py`.

If you're interested in creating an HDF5 copy of your dataset, simply invoke: `python -m vall_e.data --action='hdf5' yaml='./data/config.yaml'`

5. Train the AR and NAR models using the following scripts: `python -m vall_e.train yaml=./data/config.yaml`

You may quit your training any time by just typing `quit` in your CLI. The latest checkpoint will be automatically saved.

### Dataset Formats

Two dataset formats are supported:
* the standard way:
  - data is stored under `${speaker}/${id}.phn.txt` and `${speaker}/${id}.qnt.pt`
* using an HDF5 dataset:
  - you can convert from the standard way with the following command: `python3 -m vall_e.data yaml="./path/to/your/config.yaml"`
  - this will shove everything into a single HDF5 file and store some metadata alongside (for now, the symbol map generated, and text/audio lengths)
  - be sure to also define `use_hdf5` in your config YAML.

## Export

Both trained models *can* be exported, but is only required if loading them on systems without DeepSpeed for inferencing (Windows systems). To export the models, run: `python -m vall_e.export yaml=./data/config.yaml`.

This will export the latest checkpoints under `./data/ckpt/ar-retnet-2/fp32.pth` and `./data/ckpt/nar-retnet-2/fp32.pth` to be loaded on any system with PyTorch.

## Synthesis

To synthesize speech, invoke either (if exported the models): `python -m vall_e <text> <ref_path> <out_path> --ar-ckpt ./models/ar.pt --nar-ckpt ./models/nar.pt` or `python -m vall_e <text> <ref_path> <out_path> yaml=<yaml_path>`

Some additional flags you can pass are:
* `--max-ar-steps`: maximum steps for inferencing through the AR model. Each second is 75 steps.
* `--ar-temp`: sampling temperature to use for the AR pass. During experimentation, `0.95` provides the most consistent output.
* `--nar-temp`: sampling temperature to use for the NAR pass. During experimentation, `0.2` provides the most clean output.
* `--device`: device to use (default: `cuda`, examples: `cuda:0`, `cuda:1`, `cpu`)

## To-Do

* reduce load time for creating / preparing dataloaders.
* properly pass in `modules` names to `weight_quantization` and `activation_quantization`.
* train and release a model.
* extend to multiple languages (VALL-E X) and extend to SpeechX features.
